  <h3><b>Who are we?</b></h3>
<p>Wirelesspt.net is a mesh network project in which all routers and or routing devices that are added to it, will automatically communicate between themselves in a similar fashion how the Internet works, creating this way and identical system like the Internet but without cables or wires. This kind of network concept allows us to create a network and expand it every time we activate another router nearby.</p>
<p>Aside it's very low cost of development and implementation, another advantage of this type of network is that it cannot be completely shutdown since no one controls all routers or access points and there is no central control point.</p>
<p>The router or routing device used is exactly the same type of router that we can obtain in any regular computer store in which we will a very specific type of software/firmware developed by the wirelesspt.net and known as mvwrt. This software will make the router automatically detect the rest of the nearby mesh network, add itself to it while simultaneously help expanding it.</p>
<p>The more routers the network has the wider will be it's coverage. Some of these routers can be or will be connected to the Internet as desired and this way all wirelesspt.net users will also have Internet access.</p>

  <h3><b>How does it work?</b></h3>
<p>Wirelesspt.net is a mesh network development project that is not dependent of central infrastructure, corporation or entity which is done by the ordinary citizen with the aim to <a href="http://wirelesspt.net/wiki/Objectivos_wirelesspt" target="_blank">provide free, open and democratic access</a> to the highways of information technologies for it's users at any given time or situation through the share of technological resources within it's community, helping people and organizations implementing wireless networks that will benefit their communities.</p>
<p>The project also invests in investigating free, open source, digital, information and telecommunication technologies as well as to promote, educate and supply technological information to teach and educate it's surrounding social environment about the importance of online privacy and security.</p>
